# first-game

This is a simple game that I am using to teach myself C.

## Mechanics

There is a two-dimensional grid of pipe fittings that can be rotated by mouse click. There are straight and elbow fittings. As the game progresses, water will fill these fittings and they must connect to continue playing. The objective is to get the water to a predetermined "end" of the puzzle. There should be usually 1 or 2 viable solutions.

## Logs

04 OCT 2024 : Created Tile and TileType structs, figured out how to fill the "type" member of an initialized two-dimensional Tile array with an array of TileTypes with a pass-by-reference function. Additionally, I am able to display the matrix of values on the screen via a similar function.
